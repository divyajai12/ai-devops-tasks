Here’s a simple ASCII art diagram showing the relationship between a client, an application server, and a database:
+--------+         +-------------------+         +-----------+
| Client | <-----> | Application Server| <-----> | Database  |
+--------+         +-------------------+         +-----------+
This illustrates the typical flow:
The Client communicates with the Application Server
The Application Server interacts with the Database
Certainly! Here’s an ASCII art diagram with labeled components and arrows showing the direction of data flow:
   [Client]
      |
      v
+-------------+        +-------------------+        +-----------+
|   Browser   | -----> | Application Server| -----> | Database  |
|  or Mobile  | <----- |   (API, Logic)   | <----- | (Data)    |
+-------------+        +-------------------+        +-----------+
      ^                       ^                           ^
      |                       |                           |
   User Input           Server Response              Query Result
Explanation:
Arrows (----->) show the direction of data flow.
The client (browser or mobile) sends requests to the application server.
The application server processes logic and communicates with the database.
Responses flow back from the database to the server, and from the server to the client.
