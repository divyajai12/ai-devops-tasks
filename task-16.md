# Main Differences Between Bash and PowerShell in the Database Backup Script Example

1. **Variable Declaration**
   - **Bash:** Variables are declared without a symbol (e.g., `DB_NAME="app_database"`).
   - **PowerShell:** Variables are declared with a `$` prefix (e.g., `$DB_NAME = "app_database"`).

2. **String Interpolation**
   - **Bash:** Uses double quotes and curly braces for variable interpolation (e.g., `${DB_NAME}`).
   - **PowerShell:** Uses double quotes and variables directly inside the string (e.g., `$DB_NAME`).

3. **Directory and File Operations**
   - **Bash:** Uses commands like `mkdir -p` and `if [ ! -d "$BACKUP_DIR" ]; then ... fi` for directory checks and creation.
   - **PowerShell:** Uses cmdlets like `Test-Path` and `New-Item -ItemType Directory` for these operations.

4. **Command Execution and Piping**
   - **Bash:** Uses native piping (e.g., `mysqldump ... | gzip > file`).
   - **PowerShell:** Can use native cmdlets or call external commands, but complex pipes with external tools may require invoking `cmd.exe /c` for compatibility.

5. **Exit Codes and Error Handling**
   - **Bash:** Checks the exit status of the last command with `$?`.
   - **PowerShell:** Uses `$LASTEXITCODE` to check the exit code of the last external command.

6. **User Input (Password Prompt)**
   - **Bash:** Prompts for the password interactively with `-p` in `mysqldump`.
   - **PowerShell:** Uses `Read-Host -AsSecureString` for secure password input and must convert it for use in command-line tools.

7. **Path Separators**
   - **Bash:** Uses forward slashes (`/`) for paths.
   - **PowerShell:** Uses backslashes (`\`) for Windows paths.

8. **Script Shebang**
   - **Bash:** Starts with `#!/bin/bash`.
   - **PowerShell:** No shebang is required; scripts typically have a `.ps1` extension. 
The main differences between Bash and PowerShell in the database backup script example have been summarized and saved in task-16.md. This includes differences in variable declaration, string interpolation, directory operations, command execution, error handling, user input, path separators, and script conventions
