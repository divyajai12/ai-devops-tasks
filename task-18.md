Here are 5 key security practices for Docker applications in production:
Use Official and Minimal Base Images:
Always use official images from trusted sources and prefer minimal base images (like Alpine) to reduce the attack surface and vulnerabilities.
Keep Images Up to Date:
Regularly update your Docker images to include the latest security patches and remove unused or outdated images from your environment.
Run Containers with Least Privilege:
Avoid running containers as the root user. Use the USER directive in your Dockerfile to specify a non-root user, and limit container capabilities.
Limit Container Resources and Access:
Use Docker’s resource limits (--memory, --cpus) and restrict network access with user-defined networks and firewall rules. Mount only necessary volumes and use read-only mounts when possible.
Scan Images and Monitor Containers:
Use automated tools to scan images for vulnerabilities (e.g., Trivy, Clair) and monitor running containers for suspicious activity or configuration drift.
Implementing these practices helps reduce risks and strengthens the security posture of your Dockerized applications in production.
Here’s how you can implement the first practice—using official and minimal base images—in your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml:
In your Dockerfile
Use an official image:
Start your Dockerfile with an official image from Docker Hub, such as node, python, or nginx.
Use a minimal variant:
Many official images offer a minimal version, often with the -alpine tag (e.g., node:18-alpine, python:3.11-alpine). Alpine images are much smaller and have fewer built-in packages, reducing the attack surface.
Example:
# Use the official, minimal Node.js image
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
In your docker-compose.yml
Reference the Dockerfile:
When building your own image, ensure your docker-compose.yml points to the Dockerfile that uses the official/minimal base image.
Or use an official image directly:
For services like databases or web servers, use the official images from Docker Hub.
Example:
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
Summary:
In your Dockerfile, use official and minimal images (like node:18-alpine).
In your docker-compose.yml, either build from that Dockerfile or use official images directly (like nginx:alpine, postgres:alpine).
This approach ensures your containers start from a trusted, minimal, and secure foundation.
