The CI/CD process automates the steps required to deliver code changes quickly and reliably. It starts when a developer makes a commit to the code repository. This triggers the build stage, where the application is compiled and packaged. Next, the code undergoes testing to ensure quality and catch any issues early. If all tests pass, the application is automatically deployed to the target environment, making new features or fixes available to users. This streamlined workflow helps teams deliver software faster and with greater confidence.
