Explanation of Each Stage
Checkout

Pulls the latest source code from the repository configured in Jenkins (checkout scm uses the configured Git repo).

Ensures the pipeline works with the latest code.

Install Dependencies

Runs npm install to download and install all Node.js dependencies defined in package.json.

Prepares the environment for building and testing.

Run Tests

Executes npm test to run unit tests or other tests configured in the project.

Validates that the code is working as expected before continuing.

Build App

Runs npm run build to compile or bundle the application (e.g., using Webpack or another tool).

Produces a build artifact ready for deployment or packaging.

Build Docker Image

Uses the Docker Pipeline plugin to build a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the repository.

Tags the image with a unique tag based on the Jenkins build number.

Publish Docker Image

Authenticates with the Docker registry using stored Jenkins credentials.

Pushes the built Docker image to the specified Docker registry for storage and later deployment.

Best Practices for Jenkins Pipelines
Use Declarative Pipelines:
Declarative syntax is easier to read, maintain, and offers built-in features like post blocks.

Keep Stages Small and Focused:
Each stage should have a single clear responsibility, making troubleshooting easier.

Use Environment Variables:
Store configuration (registry URLs, credentials IDs, etc.) as environment variables for easy updates and security.

Use Credentials Plugin:
Never hardcode secrets or credentials. Store them securely in Jenkins Credentials and reference by ID.

Fail Fast:
Run tests early to catch issues before wasting resources on later stages.

Parallelize Where Possible:
For larger projects, run tests or builds in parallel to speed up pipelines.

Use Caching:
Cache dependencies (npm install) or Docker layers to reduce build time.

Add Notifications:
Integrate Slack, email, or other notifications to alert on pipeline status.

Include Post Actions:
Use post blocks to clean up resources, archive artifacts, or notify on success/failure.

Version Control Your Jenkinsfile:
Keep your pipeline definition in your project repo for transparency and version tracking.
