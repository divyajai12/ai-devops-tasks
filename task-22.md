Strengths:
Clear structure: The README is well organized into logical sections: Description, Installation, Usage, API Endpoints.

Basic usage instructions: It guides users on how to clone, install dependencies, set environment variables, and start the server.

Endpoint overview: The API endpoints are clearly listed in a table with HTTP methods, URLs, and short descriptions.

Filter explanation: Query parameters for filtering tasks are mentioned briefly.

Conciseness: The README keeps things short and to the point, which is great for a simple project.

Areas for Improvement:
Lack of examples: Including sample requests/responses (e.g., JSON bodies for POST/PUT or example curl/Postman commands) would greatly improve usability.

Authorization details: The note about authorization is vague — specifying what kind (e.g., JWT, API key) and how to authenticate would help users.

Error handling: No mention of error codes or responses; adding that could aid developers consuming the API.

Environment variables: It would be useful to list all required env vars explicitly and describe their purpose.

Versioning and dependencies: No info on Node.js version compatibility or main dependencies.

Contribution guidelines: If this is a collaborative project, a section on contributing or issues reporting is helpful.

License info: Usually a README includes license type and info for open source projects.
Summary
The README is a solid starting point — it provides all the basic info needed to get the API up and running quickly. Adding examples, more detailed explanations, and clarifying authorization would enhance developer experience and reduce setup friction.
