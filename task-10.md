It is important to ignore these files in your .gitignore for several reasons:
node_modules/
This directory contains all the packages your project depends on. It can be very large and is easily recreated by running npm install or yarn install, so thereâ€™s no need to include it in version control.
Log files (logs/, .log, npm-debug.log, etc.)
Log files are generated during development and runtime. They can grow quickly, contain sensitive information, and are not useful for other developers or in production.
Environment files (.env)
These files often contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. Committing them to version control can expose this information to others.
By ignoring these files, you:
Keep your repository clean and free from unnecessary or large files.
Protect sensitive data from being accidentally shared.
Ensure that only the essential code and configuration needed to build and run the project are tracked in version control.
