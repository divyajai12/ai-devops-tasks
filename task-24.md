Interpretation & Potential Issues
Response Time Variability

Average response time of 230ms is decent, but the 99th percentile at 1200ms (1.2 seconds) is quite high.

This indicates that while most requests are handled quickly, a small subset are significantly slower, potentially causing poor user experience for some clients.

5xx Errors (~0.8%)

120 errors out of 15,000 requests is a non-trivial error rate.

These server errors can degrade user trust and indicate instability or unhandled exceptions.

Resource Usage

CPU average at 45% with spikes up to 80% suggests the server sometimes experiences heavy load or inefficient processing.

Memory usage averaging 2.1GB but peaking at 3.5GB (close to the 4GB limit) could risk hitting limits, causing performance degradation or crashes.

Suggestions to Improve Performance
Investigate High Latency Requests

Use profiling and request tracing tools (e.g., APM tools like New Relic, Datadog, Jaeger) to identify slow endpoints or database queries.

Optimize or cache expensive operations causing latency spikes.

Reduce 5xx Errors

Analyze logs to pinpoint root causes of errors.

Improve error handling, add retry mechanisms, and validate inputs thoroughly.

Optimize Resource Usage

Profile CPU usage to find bottlenecks in code or inefficient libraries.

Consider refactoring or load distribution (e.g., horizontal scaling, load balancing).

Monitor memory usage closely; investigate possible leaks or inefficient data handling.

Caching and Rate Limiting

Implement caching layers (Redis, CDN) for frequent, read-heavy endpoints.

Apply rate limiting or throttling to protect the API during traffic spikes.

Infrastructure Scaling

If resource limits are regularly approached, consider scaling vertically (more CPU/RAM) or horizontally (multiple instances).

Use container orchestration (Kubernetes) or cloud auto-scaling for dynamic resource management.
