ERROR: for app  Cannot start service app: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint app (172.18.0.2): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3000: bind: address already in use

What the error means:
The error message:
Apply to check_docker...
means that Docker is trying to start a container and map port 3000 on your computer, but something else is already using port 3000. Because only one process can use a specific port at a time, Docker cannot start your container with this port mapping.
How to fix it:
Find out what is using port 3000:
On Windows, open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This will show you the process ID (PID) using port 3000.
On Linux/macOS, run:
Apply to check_docker...
Run
Stop the process using port 3000:
If it’s another Docker container, stop it with:
Apply to check_docker...
Run
If it’s another application, you can stop it from Task Manager (Windows) or with kill <PID> (Linux/macOS).
Try starting your Docker container again.
Alternatively, change the port mapping in your Docker configuration (like docker-compose.yml or your docker run command) to use a different port, for example:
Apply to check_docker...
This maps port 3001 on your computer to port 3000 in the container.
Summary:
The error means port 3000 is already in use. Free up the port or use a different one in your Docker setup to resolve the issue.
