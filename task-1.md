DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and monitoring throughout all stages of software development, from integration and testing to delivery and deployment. By fostering a culture of shared responsibility, DevOps helps teams respond more quickly to customer needs and market changes.

The three most popular tools used in DevOps are:
Jenkins – An open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
Docker – A platform for containerizing applications, making them portable and consistent across different environments.
Kubernetes – An orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
