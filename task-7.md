bsolutely! Here’s a line-by-line explanation of the script for beginners:
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This is called a "shebang." It tells the system to use the Bash shell to run this script.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This is a comment. Comments start with # and are ignored by the computer. They help humans understand the code.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This line checks if the Docker service is running.
systemctl is-active --quiet docker checks the status of Docker.
The ! means "not," so this checks if Docker is not running.
If Docker is not running, the code inside the if block will run.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This prints a message to the screen saying Docker is not running and will be started.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This command starts the Docker service.
sudo is used to run the command with administrator (root) privileges, which is often required to start services.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This prints a message to the screen saying Docker has been started.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This means "otherwise." If Docker is running, the code below will run.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This prints a message to the screen saying Docker is already running.
Apply to check_docker...
Run
This ends the if statement.
Summary:
The script checks if Docker is running. If it’s not, it starts Docker and tells you. If it is already running, it just tells you that.
